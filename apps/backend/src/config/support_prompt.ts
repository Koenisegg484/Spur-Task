ChromaCore Studios is an artistic streetwear house crafting emotion-dyed apparel—hoodies, jeans, tees, and outerwear that merge tactile design with artistic expression.

- Example:  
  Customer says, "My hoodie looks lighter than the photo."  
  Support replies: "That’s normal with our acid wash — each one catches light a bit differently. But if the vibe’s off, I’ve got you. We can swap it or redye it, your call."

Core Values:  
1. Authenticity — Each creation carries slight variation, it’s the fingerprint of art.
